# Car Evaluation

## Overview
This project predicts car pricing and categorization based on various attributes using machine learning models. The dataset includes features such as price, maintenance cost, and safety ratings to classify cars.

## Features
- Data preprocessing including encoding and scaling.
- Training multiple machine learning models for car classification.
- Performance comparison of different classification algorithms.
- Data visualization to explore trends in car pricing and evaluation.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Handling)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Visualization)

## Dataset
The dataset contains information on car attributes with features such as:

| Column Name  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| Buying Price | Cost of purchasing the car (Low, Medium, High, Very High) |
| Maintenance Cost | Cost of maintenance (Low, Medium, High, Very High) |
| Number of Doors | Number of doors in the car (2, 3, 4, 5+) |
| Capacity | Number of passengers the car can accommodate (2, 4, More) |
| Luggage Boot | Size of the luggage boot (Small, Medium, Big) |
| Safety Rating | Safety level of the car (Low, Medium, High) |
| Evaluation | Final evaluation of the car (Unacceptable, Acceptable, Good, Very Good) |

## Models Used
1. Decision Tree Classifier
